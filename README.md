# Blinking Red LED - "Hello World" of Embedded Electronics

Welcome to my journey into the world of embedded systems. This is where it all begins—**a blinking red LED**. It's simple, sure, but it's the foundational "Hello World" for anyone serious about mastering electronics.

## 🧭 Why I'm Doing This
I’ve decided to become the kind of engineer who builds things from the ground up. Not just someone who plugs in modules and hopes for the best, but a real-deal, working-class tech wizard. My goal? To earn every ounce of knowledge, starting with the most basic building block: blinking a red LED.

### ⚠️ Lessons from the Start
You can’t just plug an LED into a battery. You’ll burn it out. The LED is a one-way street for current, and if you skip the resistor, it’s toast. This was my first electrical reality check: physics doesn’t care about your enthusiasm.
